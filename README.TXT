To start the game, enter players names and ages, the youngest player goes first. On each players turn, they must choose from one of the following actions:

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
To start...
1. Run the driver file from the BlueJ console. 
2. When the screen opens, enter player names and ages.
3. The game will begin, player 1 must choose ONE of the following actions:
   -draw transportation cards
   -claim a route
   -draw destination tickets
   This is continued for each of the players.

Drawing Transportation Cards... 
4. If the player chooses to draw transportation cards, they can draw two cards, either from 
   the face-up cards or from the top of the deck. If the player chooses to take a face-up 
   card, they must flip a replacement card face-up from the deck. 
5. The player then draws a second card, from either the top of the deck or from the face up  
   cards. When a transportation card is chosen from the face-up deck, it is added to the  
   players hand. 
6. For each players turn, if a transportation card is chosen, continue until the deck is empty  
   and no discards are available. When cards are no longer available, the players can no 
   longer draw transportation cards. Instead, they can only claim a route or draw a 
   destination ticket card. 

Claiming Routes... 
7. When claiming a route, the player must play a set of cards that is equal to the number of 
   spaces that are in that route, in order to be able to claim it. This set of cards must be 
   of the same type! Each player can claim only one route on their turn. For the cities that 
   are connected by double-routes, the player cannot claim both routes to the same cities, 
   within one turn. 
8. When a route is claimed, the player moves their car on each of the spaces of the route. 
9. A route can only be claimed once within each game. When one player claims it, another 
   cannot claim it as well. All cards that are used to claim a route are discarded.

Destination Ticket Cards...
10. A player can draw destination ticket cards by drawing three new cards from the top of the
   destination ticket deck. At least one of the cards must be kept, but two or all three may
   be kept. Returned cards are placed on the bottom of the deck. 
11.Destination tickets include the name of two cities on the map and a point value. When the
   a play completes a connection between two cities, they will score the points at the end of    
   the game. If a player fails to make a connection between two cities, the indicated amount 
   of points will be deducted. Keep destination tickets a secret but hold on to as many as 
   many as desired.

Ending the Game...
12.A players final turn begins when their number of transportation cars gets down to two or 
   less. After this turn, the game ends and players calculate their final score. 

Calculating Scores...
13.Points earned from completed routes have already been calculated throughout the game. 
14.Players reveal all of their destination tickets and then add or subtract the indicated 
   values.


Good luck!
